The neural networks based on their computational unit can be distinguished into three generations:
1. **First Generation**: This generation of neural networks included the perceptron, hopfield networks, boltzmann machines etc.<br>
2. **Second Generation**: This generation of neural networks included multi-layer neural nets, recurrent networks etc.<br>
3. **Third Generation**: This generation of neural networks includes the Spiking neural networks which is a more realistic representation of the working and information flow within the brain.<br><br>


This repository contains the code and simulations of the **LIF(leaky integrate and fire) neuron model** and the **Izhikevich neuron model** along with most of their configurational variations to simulate various modes of operations of the neurons in the human brain. These neuron models very closly represent the functions of the neurons in the brain in the form of mathematical differential equations because it is considered that the brain is a robust signal processing system. <br><br>

The purpose of this repository is to model the behaviour of the brain so that these models can be later be modified and implemented in Spiking Neural Networks.
